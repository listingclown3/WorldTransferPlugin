# WorldTransferPlugin
I made this plugin a while ago but I thought why not post Source Code here, it's pretty short and irrelevant. I think it was just because there was no Multiverse Plugin for 1.8.9 so I believed, so I was like "Let's make one myself". Then it took forever, and ever, and ever, and now there's this thing... yeah. Enjoy!

Also, yes, I know there is no delete world command, I couldn't find one on Google and I have a peanut sized brain. 
DM me on Discord if you have a solution because most things I tried didn't work.

I might have a solution but I don't know.
